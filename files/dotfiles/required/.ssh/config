# Add ssh details for your servers to this file.
#
# For each server, you should include the information in this example at a
# minimum:
#
# Host my-app-server
#     User my_username
#     HostName 12.34.56.789
#     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/rsa_id
#
# Specifying "IdentityFile" is optional, but very useful if you have multiple
# ssh key-pairs.
