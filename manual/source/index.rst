Crosshair is a fully-configured Xmonad environment based on Debian stable.

**Reading Chapter 1 should take less than 5 minutes** and give you everything
you need to get started.

The other chapters contain more specific information and you should refer to
them as necessary.

See the appendices for tips on how to get the most out of using Crosshair.
