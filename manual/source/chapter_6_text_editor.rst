======================
Chapter 6: Text editor
======================

Vim is Crosshair's text editor.

A working knowledge of Vim is assumed, and so an introduction to Vim is beyond
the scope of this manual.

Whatever your level of experience with Vim though, the
:doc:`appendix_6_vim_cheatsheet` might occasionally come in handy.

Also, Crosshair customises Vim a little with key bindings and plugins so these
need explaining. Most are summarised below, and you can also look at
**~/.crosshair/dotfiles/.vimrc** directly if you're interested.


Custom Vim key bindings
-----------------------

General
~~~~~~~

- ``\`` is the Vim leader key.
- ``j`` ``k`` gives ``Escape``.
- ``\`` ``r`` opens Ranger, which can then open another file.

Buffers
~~~~~~~

- ``\`` ``n`` creates a new buffer.
- ``Tab`` moves to the next buffer.
- ``Shift`` + ``Tab`` moves to the previous buffer.

Miscellaneous
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``\`` ``p`` toggles Paste mode on and off.
- ``Space`` opens and closes a fold.
